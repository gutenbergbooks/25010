<h1>PUNCH,<br />

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

<h2>VOL. 146.</h2>

<h2>APRIL 29, 1914.</h2>

<hr class="full" />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg 321]</span><h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Captain Fort</span>, a French army airman
from Chalons, flew over the
German frontier, last week, by mistake,
and alighted in Lorraine, but flew back
again before the German police arrived.
We think he should have waited. It is
just little discourtesies such as this that
accentuate ill-feeling between nations.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">H. W. Thornton</span>, the new American
manager of the Great Eastern
Railway, says that his ideal is to
satisfy the public. This disposes of
the absurd rumour that his appointment
was made in the interests of the
shareholders.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Jack Johnson</span>, the pugilist, is about
to become naturalized as a French
subject. Frankly, America has
brought this on herself.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is possible, by the way,
that the knowledge that
America could not rely on
<span class="sc">Jack Johnson</span> stiffened President
<span class="sc">Huerta's</span> back.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In at least one of our
colonies the War Minister is
designated "Minister for
Defence." This would surely
be a more than apt title for
Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>, who has been
doing yeoman work of this
kind on behalf of his peccant
colleagues.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Some idea of the confusion
which reigned at the fight
between <span class="sc">Blake</span> and <span class="sc">Borrell</span>
may be gathered from the following
paragraph in <i>The Liverpool Daily
Post</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Blake, who was the taller, at once led the
&pound;500 aside, and both men to deposit a further
close quarters, and they indulged in in-fighting
up to the close of the round."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was certainly shrewd of <span class="sc">Blake</span> to
act as he did in regard to the stakes,
for, although he was the taller, it did
not necessarily follow that he would
win.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Stafford House, which contains the
London Museum, will in future be
called Lancaster House. It was felt,
we understand, that its former name
gave no clue to its contents.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We find the following announcement
of the greatest interest:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"April 16th, to Mr. and Mrs. G. E. Turtle
(n&eacute;e Nurse Lacey) a daughter."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was a great performance to have
been born a nurse, even if she turned
Turtle later on.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"In everything where her means and
opportunities allow," says Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
Rackham</span>, "woman seeks persistently
for beauty." And now many husbands
are flattering themselves that that is
how they came to be married.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Mothers who sleep nine hours on
end," says Dr. <span class="sc">Westcott</span>, the coroner,
"should not have babies, and, if they
do, they should be put in cradles."
The only difficulty is that at present
there is no cradle on the market large
enough to take a grown-up.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Times</i> has published an indictment
of the London plane-tree as a
disseminator of disease. Nervous folk,
however, may like to know that, if they
stay indoors with their windows closed
and with a towel fastened across the
mouth and nose, they will run comparatively
little risk from this source.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Express</i> is offering prizes to its
readers with a view to ascertaining
which is the best-looking animal in
the Zoo, and which is the ugliest. It
is, of course, no affair of ours, but
we think it would be a graceful and
humane act on the part of our contemporary
to give a consolation prize to
the poor beast adjudged to be the ugliest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Meanwhile, in view of this competition,
the wart-hog would be glad to
hear of a really reliable cure for warts.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A thrush has built its nest and laid
three eggs at the junction of two
scaffold poles where between fifty and
sixty men are working on a new building
at Northampton. The kind-hearted
labourers were, we understand, willing
to work quietly and slowly in order not
to disturb the young mother, but were
over-ridden by the foremen.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What is described as a "Racegoers'
Luncheon Palace" is being erected
next to the Epsom Grand Stand. The
new building will, we are informed,
have fireproof floors and staircases.
These will no doubt be duly tested by
the Militants.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is rumoured that such is the
success of <i>The Melting Pot</i> that Mr.
<span class="sc">Zangwill</span> has been approached by
more than one manager with flattering
proposals. Mr. <span class="sc">Zangwill</span>, however, is
not to be rushed, and it is extremely
unlikely that we shall have him turning
out Melting Pot-Boilers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The punishment does sometimes fit
the crime. An individual who for some
months past specialised in thefts of
clocks was last week given time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"A Blackburn platelayer,"
it is stated, "who has just
died at the age of seventy,
left &pound;400, which he had
accumulated out of his small
earnings. He was a bachelor."
Married women consider this
a marvellous achievement in
view of the fact that the man
had no wife to help him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At last it looks as if something
is going to be done for
golfers, whose language, it is
rumoured, occasionally leaves
so much to be desired. The
Rector of Frinton has undertaken
to consider a suggestion
that a special service for
golfers shall be held at nine
o'clock on Sunday mornings.</p>

<h2>A "SCENE" IN 1916.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Showing the Development of Parliamentary Manners.</span></p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Asquith.</span></i> I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether
he will grant a full judicial enquiry into the recent military
and naval movements contemplated by the Government
in Munster.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Law</span></i> (who was greeted by shouts of "Assassin").
I see no necessity for any such enquiry. I am prepared
to answer for the Government on the floor of this House.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Lloyd George.</span></i> May I ask the right honourable
gentleman how many members of the Government are
interested in armament companies, and to what extent they
would have profited by the contemplated Tipperary pogrom?
(Shouts of "Yah," "Thieves!" "Thieves!" "Brigands!"
and "Yah!")</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Law.</span></i> I utterly and entirely repudiate the suggestion
of the right honourable gentleman. (Opposition shouts
of "Liar" and "Coward.") The information the right
honourable gentleman has gained during his intrigues with
the rank and file of the Welsh regiments is totally&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Speaker.</span></i> Order, order. That reply obviously does
not arise from the question.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Asquith.</span></i> I wish to ask the right honourable gentleman
if he is prepared to make a statement on oath.
Nothing else will convince the country, as it knows by
experience that Ministers are steeped in falsehood.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Law.</span></i> That is an allegation against the honour of
Ministers. (<i><span class="sc">Mr. Churchill</span></i>, "They have none.") If the
Leader of the Opposition desires to attempt to substantiate
these charges I will give him a day&mdash;or a week, if he wants it.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Swift MacNeill.</span></i> Afraid of five years for perjury.
Blackguards!</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Amery</span> (President of the Local Government Board).</i>
Mr. Speaker, should I be in order if I appealed to you to ask
Members on the other side to maintain the honourable
traditions of this House?</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. John Ward.</span></i> All they care for is the &pound;5,000 a year.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Speaker.</span></i> Order, order! I must ask honourable
members not to turn Question time into a debate.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Churchill.</span></i> I beg to ask the Prime Minister
whether the guns of the first cruiser squadron are not at
this moment trained on Limerick, and to ask him if ample
time will be given for women and children to escape before
the massacre begins?</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Bonar Law.</span></i> The first cruiser squadron is not at
Limerick. (Loud shouts of "Liar!") That disposes of
the second part of the question also. (Cries of "No!"
"Shame!" "Child-murderer!")</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Lord Winterton</span> (Junior Lord of the Treasury).</i> Mr.
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>, may I draw your attention to the fact that several
Members of the Opposition shout "Liar" at the Prime
Minister whenever he rises to his feet?</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Speaker.</span></i> The term is certainly an objectionable
one, but unfortunately there are Parliamentary precedents.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Raymond Asquith.</span></i> Yes, that's what he used to call
Papa.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Lloyd George.</span></i> May I ask the Prime Minister if it
is true that victims of the Celtic pogrom are to be refused
treatment by their panel doctors?</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Law.</span></i> As there will be no victims (shouts of "Found
out" and "Afraid") the question of medical treatment does
not arise.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. John Redmond.</span></i> Enough of this foolery. Enough of
the deliberate falsehood of Ministers. I go to Ireland at
once, where half a million resolute, dour, determined men
are ready to defy this Government of assassins.</p>

<p>(Loud Opposition cheers and waving of handkerchiefs, as
Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span> retires from the House.)</p>

<p>Born in Odessa In 1901,

and at 13 years of age thinking
nothing of his 900 mile Walk to
the Fair at Nijni-Novgorod,

our hero&mdash;the "poularde
de Surrey"&mdash;at last arrives
in London.</p>

<p>Now, how to make this treasure palatable to the British Public?


First of all we'll catch him
(the British Public) in our
cosy Appetiser Department.

Then Signor Sarsaparillo shall
entertain him in the cloak-room.</p>

<p>We'll waft him up to the
dining-room to the strains
of the Blue Danubian Band.

We'll give him "La Boh&ecirc;me"
before the "poularde";

and the Maxixe during.

A Terrible Turk shall
give him coffee (with
Coon accompaniment);

and we'll send him home with
a silver-mounted sterilised
tooth-pick and presents for
Madame and Baby. There!</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg 328]</span><h2>THE IMPRESSING OF PERKINS.</h2>

<p>"I hope," said my friend and host,
Charles, "I hope that you'll manage
to be comfortable."</p>

<p>I looked round as much of the room
as I could see from where I stood and
ventured also to hope that I should.</p>

<p>"The tap to the right," he said, indicating
the amenities, "is hot water;
the left tap is cold, and the tap in the
middle...."</p>

<p>"Lukewarm?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Soft water, for shaving and so on.
But Perkins will see to it."</p>

<p>Some people can assume a sort of
detached attitude in the early morning,
while body-servants get them up and
dress them and send them downstairs,
but me, I confess, these attentions
overawe. "Perkins is one of those
strong silent men, is he not," I asked,
"who creep into one's bedroom in the
morning and steal one's clothes when
one isn't looking?"</p>

<p>Charles has no sympathy with Spartans
and did not answer. "I think
you'll find everything you want.
There's a telephone by the bed." I
said that I was not given to talking in
my sleep. "Then," said he, "if you
prefer to write here is the apparatus,"
and he pointed to a desk that would
have satisfied all the needs of a daily
editor.</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said, looking at the
attractive bed, "but I expect to be too
busy in the morning even to write." I
yawned comfortably. "Though it may
be that I shall dictate, from where I
lie, a note or two to my stenographer."</p>

<p>Charles doubted, with all solemnity,
whether Perkins could manage shorthand,
but promised to enquire about it.
He's a dear solid fellow, is Charles, and
he does enjoy being rich. Moreover,
he means his friends to enjoy it, too.
Lastly, "If you don't find everything
you want," he said, "you've only to
ring," and he pointed to a, row of pear-shaped
appendages hanging by silken
cords from the cornice.</p>

<p>"Heavens," said I, seizing his arm,
"you're never going to leave a defenceless
man alone with half-a-dozen
bell-pushes!"</p>

<p>Charles softened; he admits to a
weakness for electricity. "Some are
switches, some are bell-pushes, and
one," he said, blushing, "is a fire-alarm."</p>

<p>I climbed on to a chair forthwith
and tied a big knot in the cord of the
fire-alarm. "We'll get that safe out
of the way first," said I, and then he
tutored me in the use of the others.
After some repetition it was drummed
into me that the one nearest the bed
was the switch of the getting-into-bed
light, and the next one to that the
bell which rang in Perkins' upstairs
quarters, The other four or five I
found, when I came to study them
alone, I had forgotten.</p>

<p>I clambered into bed and with great
intelligence pressed the correct switch.
Had I left it at that my problem would
never have arisen.</p>

<p>I have, however, a confession to
make which ill accords with my
luxurious surroundings of the moment.
It is that I am accustomed to press
my trousers myself by the homely and
ignoble expedient of sleeping on them.
My only excuse is that I am a heavy
sleeper. So automatic is the process,
that I was wrapped in sheets and darkness
before it occurred to me that I
had placed the trousers I had just
doffed under the mattress on which I
now lay. I could not help thinking
how the masterful Perkins would take
it when he came to look for them in
the morning. I conceived him picking
up my dinner-jacket here, my waistcoat
there, and wandering round the room
in a hopeless quest for the complement
of my suit, trying to recall the
events of the previous night and to
remember whether I was English or
Scottish ... and then, more in sorrow
than in anger, spotting the lost ones....</p>

<p>As I contemplated this picture I was
moved to pity Perkins, torn asunder
between two dreadful alternatives, the
one of leaving the trousers there and
committing a dereliction of duty, the
other of removing them stealthily and
committing an indelicacy. I was also
moved to pity myself, lying supine
under his speechless contempt. I resolved
to spare us both, to get out of
bed and put things right. I stretched
out a hand for the switch. I grasped
it with an effort. I pressed the button.</p>

<p>No light ensued.</p>

<p>I pressed again ... and again ...
with no visible result. I pressed once
more, and still there was a marked
absence of light. I lay back in bed
and, cursing Charles, thought out his
instructions. Cautiously I reached out
again, pressed once more and succeeded.
The continued oscillation of the second
cord revealed to me what you have
already guessed, that I had meanwhile
rung the bell in Perkins' sleeping
quarters four times.</p>

<p>To me the approaching climax was
horrible; I could see no way of dealing
with the situation shortly about to
arise. To those who have never known
and feared Perkins or his like it may
seem that there were at least two
simple courses to pursue: to lie boldly
and deny that I had rung; or to tell
the truth and admit that I had made a
mistake. Men like Perkins, however,
are not to be lied to; still less may they
be made the recipients of confessions.
Methods of self-defence were therefore
unthinkable, and I knew instinctively
that I must assume the offensive. I
must order him curtly, upon his arrival,
to do something. But what? As I
waited anxiously I tried to think of
some service I could require at this
hour. What can a man want at 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>
except to go to sleep? Even the richest
must do that for himself.</p>

<p>There were footsteps outside....
Perkins'.... I thought harder than
I have ever thought before, but my
life seemed replete with every modern
comfort.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir?" said Perkins.</p>

<p>"Ah, is that you, Perkins?" said I
to gain time, and he said it was.</p>

<p>I shut my eyes and tried to think.
Perkins stood silent. I had some idea
of leaving it at that, of turning out the
light and letting Perkins decide upon
his own course of action. I was just
about to do this when I had a brain
wave. After all, he was paid to do the
dirty work and not I.</p>

<p>At that moment I was anticipated.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do for you,
Sir?" said the Model.</p>

<p>"There is," said I, in my most <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i>
voice. "Kindly turn out my light."</p>

<p>Perkins may have been annoyed
about this, but he was certainly impressed.
His demeanour suggested that
he had met autocrats before but never
such a thorough autocrat as I. For the
rest of my time there I pressed my
trousers in the usual way, well knowing
that he would regard the process not
as the makeshift of a valetless pauper
but as the eccentricity of an overstaffed
multi-billionaire.</p>

<h2>ASKING FOR IT.</h2>

<p>The big clock in the station pointed three minutes to the
hour, and my train went at one minute past, so I didn't
waste words with the man in the booking-office.</p>

<p>"Third r'turn, Wat'loo."</p>

<p>Nothing happened. He was there all right, but he
neither spoke nor made any attempt to give me my ticket;
he merely looked.</p>

<p>"Third r'turn, Wat'loo," I repeated, and again, inserting
my face as far as possible into the window, very firmly,
distinctly and offensively. "Third re-turn, Wat-er-loo."</p>

<p>Then he spoke, slowly. "Sorry, Sir, I can't do it. You
have hit on the one station to which we don't issue tickets.
Any other one I could manage for you, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here," I said sternly, "you don't seem to know
your business. If you haven't got a printed ticket, can't
you make one out on paper? Hurry up, man; my train
leaves in a minute or two."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said more slowly than ever, "I could do
that&mdash;we have blank forms for that purpose; but all the
same I won't do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't? And why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what the fare is. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "You don't appear to be drunk, so I
imagine you're trying to be funny. As your sense of
humour doesn't correspond with mine I shall take great
pleasure in reporting you to the station-master;" and I
prepared to stalk off.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, please," he said, leaning a bit forward
and dropping his voice to a confidential whisper, "I'll
give you a tip. You don't want a ticket at all, Sir; you
can get there for nothing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said I.</p>

<p>"It needn't cost you a halfpenny," he went on, smiling.
"It's not many lines that have a station like this, but
we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then, but not until then, did I realise where I was.</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "er&mdash;third return&mdash;er&mdash;Surbiton."</p>

<p>I don't think railway ticket-mongers ought to be allowed

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April
10.</i>&mdash;Lively half-hour with Questions.
Cluster on printed Paper indefinitely
extended by supplementaries. Only
once did <span class="sc">Speaker</span> interpose. Colonel
<span class="sc">Greig</span>, sternly regarding badgered
<span class="sc">Premier</span>, asked, "Has the attention of
the right hon. gentleman been directed
to No. 453 of the King's Regulations?"</p>

<p>This too much for <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. If it
had been the odd 53 it might not have
been unreasonable.</p>

<p>"The right hon. gentleman," he
remarked, "cannot be expected to carry
all the Regulations in his head. The
hon. member had better give notice."</p>

<p>Cannonade of Questions which opened
along full length of Opposition Benches
was concerned with the Plot.</p>

<p>"The Plot!" <span class="sc">Member for Sark</span>
savagely repeated. "That's the ineffective
heading in the newspapers.
In order to keep up their circulation in
parsonages, board-rooms of directors,
and suchlike fastidious quarters they
are reticent with adjectives. It's only
Mrs. <span class="sc">Patrick Campbell</span> who could
select the appropriate one and give it
due emphasis."</p>

<p>Short of that, Opposition did pretty
well in denunciation of the Plot and
condemnation of dastardly Government
responsible for its planning. <span class="sc">Chaloner</span>
opened fire with demand that judicial
enquiry should be ordered into "allegations
as to an unauthorised plot
to over-awe Ulster by armed occupation."
<span class="sc">Butcher</span>, <span class="sc">Worthington Evans</span>,
<span class="sc">Helmsley</span>, <span class="sc">Archer-Shee</span>, <span class="sc">Locker-Lampson</span>,
<span class="sc">Kinloch-Cooke</span>&mdash;what was
it <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of <span class="sc">Sclater-Booth</span>,
said of men who "had double-barrelled
names"?&mdash;blazed away.
Sometimes in succession; occasionally
in platoons. In each case imperturbable
<span class="sc">Premier</span> gave the short reply
that did not turn away wrath. On
the contrary, angry passions rose.</p>

<p>Member for East Edinburgh, as
usual going the whole <span class="sc">Hogge</span>, suggested
arraignment of <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> on
charge of high treason. <span class="sc">Kellaway</span>,
anxious to get to business, enquired
"whether these Questions might not
be addressed to the spies in the service
of the Opposition." At end of half-hour
even temper of <span class="sc">Premier</span> was
ruffled. Asked a tenth Supplementary
Question by <span class="sc">Butcher</span>, he sharply
replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I decline to answer any such
enquiry."</p>

<p>Ironical applause of Opposition
drowned in burst of angry cheering
from Ministerialists.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sark</span>, as mentioned, unusually roused.
As a rule successfully affects attitude
of one "who cares for none of these
things." To-day moved to unsuspected
depths.</p>

<p>"Here," he says, "is Ulster, for two
years arming with avowed intention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span>forcibly resisting the law of the land.
The Constitutional Party in this country,
bulwark of Law and Order, who, when
the Southern Counties of Ireland were
in revolt, applauded <span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span>
Cromwellian command, 'Don't hesitate
to shoot,' backs them up, in my
opinion very properly. <span class="sc">Carson</span> has developed
Napoleonic genius in reviewing
troops on parade. <span class="sc">F. E. Smith</span> has,
with startling effect, 'galloped' along
their massed ranks. <span class="sc">Londonderry</span>
has pledged his knightly word to be
in the firing line when the trumpet
sounds. All the while, to the bewilderment
of onlookers from the Continent,
who confess they are further off
than ever from understanding
John Bull, to the creation of
ominous restlessness among their
own supporters, the Ministry,
Brer Rabbit of established Governments,
have 'lain low and said
nuffin',' much less have they
done anything. Suddenly, without
word of warning, they take
steps for the protection of military
stores in Armagh, Omagh, and
Carrickfergus.</p>

<p>"That's their account of the
transaction. We know better.
It was a carefully devised Plot to
take <span class="sc">Carson's</span> hundred thousand
armed and drilled men at their
word and compel them to fight.
Not since war began has there
been such unjustifiable&mdash;don't
wish to use strong language, but
must say&mdash;such really rude procedure
on part of a so-called
civilised Government."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">McKenna</span>
moves Second Heading of Welsh
Church Disestablishment Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Wholesome spirit of
enquiry animates House just now.
<span class="sc">Bonner Law</span> leads off with
demand for judicial inquiry into "the
Plot." Fact that its appointment
would establish novel precedent in constitutional
procedure adds interest to
situation. <span class="sc">Premier</span>, with emphatic
thump of the table that reminds it
of <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> in his prime, stands by
constitutional practice.</p>

<p>"If," he said, "the right hon. gentleman
is prepared to make and sustain
his allegation of dishonourable conduct
on part of the Ministers, I will give
him the earliest possible day to bring
it forward. But," and here came the
thump on the long-suffering table, "he
must make it in this House."</p>

<p>Inspired by this high principle of
getting at bottom of shady things,
<span class="sc">Richardson</span> has <span class="sc">Chief Whip</span> up and
sternly questions him about appointment
of certain public auditors under
Industrial and Provident Acts.</p>

<p>Position of <span class="sc">Chief Whip</span>, though dignified
and important, has inevitable
result of withdrawing him from participation
in debate. <span class="sc">Illingworth</span>
now has his chance. Made the most
of it. Head paper of prodigious length
containing memoirs of the two gentlemen
concerned, together with succinct
history of the birth and progress of the
Hetton Downs Co-operative Society,
county Durham, of which one of them
had been secretary.</p>

<p>House entranced. Rounds of cheering
marked progress of narrative, concluding
passages inconveniently rendered
inaudible by tumultuous applause.</p>

<p>Apprehension in some quarters that
this will be the ruin of a really capable,
universally popular Whip. <span class="sc">Edmund
Talbot</span> goes so far as to hint at apprehension
that <span class="sc">Illingworth</span> will turn
up every afternoon at Question time
and give us another speech.</p>

<p>Fear exaggerated. <span class="sc">Illingworth</span> a
shrewd Yorkshireman; knows very well
brilliant success of to-day was due to
concatenation of accidental circumstance.
Not likely to risk suddenly
acquired reputation by hasty repetition

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Welsh Church Disestablishment

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Spirit of enquiry alluded
to above manifests itself in fresh
direction. The other day <span class="sc">Charles
Price</span> wanted to know all about political
pensions granted to ex-Ministers.
Intrigued by disclosure of particulars
of estate of our old friend <span class="sc">Grand Cross</span>.
It appears he left property valued
at &pound;91,617. That a pleasant incident
closing a worthy life. But, as Member
for Central Edinburgh points out,
he had for twenty-two years been in
receipt of pension of &pound;2,000 a year, a
dole from public funds obtainable, as
<span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> admits, only upon
statutory declaration of a state of
poverty incompatible with the maintenance
of position proper to an ex-Minister.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Price</span> wants to know in the interests
of the overburdened taxpayer whether
aggregate sum drawn by the noble
pensioner may not be recovered from
his estate? <span class="sc">Premier</span> thinks not.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Price</span>, undaunted, returns to
the attack to-day. Cites cases
of two other ex-Ministers drawing
political pensions in supplement
of private estate and fees derived
from manifold directorships in
public companies. Wants to
know if payment can be stopped?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Premier</span> says it is a matter of

<h2>MUSICAL NOTES.</h2>

<p>As a concrete protest against Jumbomania,
or the worship of mammoth
dimensions, the prodigious success of
Tiny Titus, America's latest wonder-child,
is immensely reassuring. In the
Albert Hall, where he made his <i>d&eacute;but</i>
amid scenes of corybantic enthusiasm
last week, the diminutive <i>virtuoso</i> was
hardly visible to the naked eye. (As
a matter of fact he is only 21 inches
high and weighs just under 11 lb.)
Yet by his colossal personality he
dominated the vast assemblage and
inspired the orchestra to such feats of
dynamic diabolism as entirely eclipsed
the most momentous achievements of
any full-grown conductor from <span class="sc">Nero</span>
to <span class="sc">Nikisch</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What renders the performance of
this tremendous tot so awe-inspiring
is the fact that he is not merely a
musical illiterate, who cannot yet read
a note of music, but that he has received
no education of any kind! Born
at Tipperusalem, Oklahoma, on the
15th of March, 1912, he has for
parents a clerk in the Eagle Bakery
and a Lithuanian laundress. He never
touches meat, not even baked eagles,
but subsists entirely on peaches and
popcorn. He has been compared to
<span class="sc">Mozart</span>, but the comparison is ridiculous,
for <span class="sc">Mozart</span> was carefully trained
by his father, and at the age of four
was a finished executant. But it is
quite otherwise with Tiny Titus, who
knows no music, and yet by the sole
power of his genius comprehends the
musical heights unattainable by adults.
<span class="sc">Mozart</span>, in short, was an explicable
miracle, while Tiny Titus is an insoluble
Sphinx.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>From the innumerable tributes which
have been paid to the genius of this
unprecedented phenomenon we can
only make a brief and inadequate
selection. Prince Boris Ukhtomsky
writes, "When I listen to this infinitesimal
giant of conductors I dream
that mankind is dancing on the edge
of a precipice. Tiny Titus is&mdash;the
32nd of the month." Mme. Jelly
Tartakoff, the famous singer, writes:
"I have been deeply shaken by Tiny
Titus's concert. He is the limit." Of
the homages in verse, perhaps the most
touching is the beautiful poem by
Signor Ocarini, the charm of which
we fear is but inadequately rendered in
our halting translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span><h2>PROFESSOR SPLURGESON ON
PERSONALITY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strange Conduct of Fashionable
Audience.</span></p>

<p>Professor Splurgeson delivered the
first of his Claridge Lectures at the
theatre of the Mayfair University yesterday.
The auditorium was crowded
to its utmost extent, ladies largely predominating.</p>

<p>Professor Peterson Prigwell, in a
brief introductory speech, said that the
achievements of Professor Splurgeson
beggared the vocabulary of eulogy.
More than any other thinker he had
succeeded in reconciling high life with
high thinking.</p>

<p>Professor Splurgeson, speaking in
fluent American, began by alluding to the
numerous links which bound together his
country with that of his audience, and
pointed out that nowhere was
this affinity more pronounced
than in their philosophies.
Both showed a concrete cosmopolitanism
indissolubly wedded
to an idealistic particularism;
both agreed that truth, no
matter how abysmally profound,
could be expressed in language
sufficiently simple to attract
large audiences of fashionable
women; both, finally, made it
clear that Pragmatism, unless
allied with Feminism, was destined
to be relegated to the limbo
of the obsolete. (Cheers.)</p>

<p>Professor Splurgeson then
went on to say that nowhere
was this happy element of intellectual
compromise more
needful than in discussing the
problem of personality. That problem
comprised three questions: What are
we? What do we think of ourselves?
and What do others think of us? In
regard to the first question, the philosophic
pitch had been queered by the
conflicting combinations of all thinkers
from Corcorygus the Borborygmatic
down to <span class="sc">William James</span>. (Applause.)
Man had been defined as a gelastic
apteryx, but in view of the attitude of
women towards the Plumage Bill the
definition could hardly be allowed to fit
the requirements of the spindle side of
creation. The danger of endeavouring
to find some unifying concept in a
multiplicity of conflicting details was
only equalled by that of recognizing
the essential diversity which underlay
a superficial homogeneity. (Loud
cheers.)</p>

<p>At this point the Professor paused
for a few minutes while k&uuml;mmel and
caviare sandwiches were handed round.</p>

<p>Resuming, Professor Splurgeson discussed
with great eloquence the secular
duel between the Will and the Understanding.
It was <i>ex hypothesi</i> impossible
for the super-man, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> the
super-woman, to yield to the dictates
of the understanding. The question
arose whether we might not profitably
invert metaphysic and, instead of trying
to locate personality in totality, begin
with personality and work outwards.
(Applause.) Otherwise the process of
endeavouring to effect a synthesis of
centripetal and centrifugal tendencies
would invariably result in an indefinite
deadlock.</p>

<p>Professor Splurgeson then proceeded
to give a brief outline of what we
usually think of ourselves. It was true
that the expression of the face held a
great place in the idea we had of other
personalities, but how was it that in
the idea of ourselves it played so small
a part? The reason was that we did
not know our own countenances. (Sensation.)
If we were to meet ourselves
in the street we should infallibly pass
without a recognition. More than that,
we did not wish to know them. (Murmurs.)
Whenever we looked at ourselves
in the glass we systematically
ignored the most individual features&mdash;(cries
of dissent)&mdash;and that was
why we never, or very seldom, agreed
that a photograph resembled or rendered
justice to us. The explanation
was to be found in the fact that we
thought it undesirable to have too
individual features, just as we thought
it undesirable to wear too individual
clothes.</p>

<p>At this point a violent uproar broke
out, many of those present protesting
against these statements as involving
a libel on the entire female sex. It
being impossible to restore order, Professor
Splurgeson had to be escorted
to his hotel by policemen, the date of

<p>'Twas harvest time and close and warm,</p>
<p class="i2">A day when tankards foam,</p>
<p>But when there came the thunder-storm</p>
<p class="i2">We'd got the last load home;</p>
<p>We'd knocked off work&mdash;as custom is&mdash;</p>

<p class="i2">As though 'twas only May;</p>
<p>And from outside came stock and clove</p>
<p class="i2">And half-a-dozen more;</p>
<p>And then up steps a piping cove,</p>
<p class="i2">A-piping at the door.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>We tumbles out to hear him blow,</p>

<p>On rummy pipes o' reeds a-row</p>

<p>And as he blew he shook a limb</p>
<p class="i2">And capered like a goat,</p>

<p>An oddly chap and russet red,</p>

<p>It seemed to me I'd heard it once</p>

<p>I was reading proofs in my corner
of the compartment, as I often do, and
every time that I looked up I noticed
the little shabby pathetic man with
his eyes fixed upon me.</p>

<p>After a while I finished and put the
proofs away with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"So you're an author too?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, though I didn't want
to talk at all.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have thought I was
one," he went on, "would you? What
would you have said I did for a living?"</p>

<p>I am too old to guess such things.
One nearly always gives offence. Moreover,
I have seen too many authors to
show any surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm not only a writer," he said,
"but I dare say I'm better known than
you."</p>

<p>"That's not difficult," I said.</p>

<p>"I am read by thousands&mdash;very likely
millions&mdash;every day."</p>

<p>"This is very strange," I said.
"Millions? Who are you, then? Not&mdash;no,
you can't be. You haven't a red
beard; you are not in knickerbockers;
you don't recall <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>. Nor can
you be Mrs. <span class="sc">Barclay</span>. And yet, of
course, I must have heard your name.
Might I hear it again, now?"</p>

<p>"My name is unknown," he said.
"All my work is anonymous."</p>

<p>"Not advertisements?" I said. "Not
posters'? You didn't write the 'Brown
Cat's thanks,' or 'Alas, my poor
brother,' or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he replied. "My
line is literature. Do you ever go to
cinemas?"</p>

<p>"Now and then," I said, "when it
rains, or I have an unexpected hour, or
it is too late for a play."</p>

<p>"Then you have read me," he said.
"I write for cinemas."</p>

<p>"There isn't much writing there,"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't there!" he answered.
"Haven't you ever noticed in a cinema
how letters are always being brought
in on trays?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"And then the hero or the villain
or the victim opens them and reads
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And then the audience has to read
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there's no doubt about that."</p>

<p>"Well, those are all written by me.
I mean, of course, all those that a
certain film company requires."</p>

<p>"Marvellous," I said.</p>

<p>"I not only compose them&mdash;and it
requires thought and compression, I
can tell you&mdash;but I copy them out for
the photographer too."</p>

<p>"Is that why they're always in the
same handwriting?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," he said. "It's
mine."</p>

<p>"Then you can tell me something
I have always wanted to know," I
said. "I have noticed that when a
letter written, say, by the Duke of
Pemmican is thrown on the screen it
is always signed 'Duke of Pemmican.'
Why is that? In real life wouldn't he
sign it 'Pemmican'?"</p>

<p>"He might," said my companion.
"I don't know; but what I do know
is that the cinema public expects a
duke to call himself a duke; and we
pride ourselves on giving them what
they want."</p>

<p>"If you were making <span class="sc">King George</span>
write a letter," I said, "would he sign
himself '<span class="sc">King George</span>'?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied. "Why not?
That's a good idea, anyway. A film
with a letter from the <span class="sc">King</span> in it would
go. As it is, his only place in a cinema
has been to indicate&mdash;by the appearance
of his portrait on the screen&mdash;that the
show is over. It isn't fair that he
should come to be looked upon as a
spoil-sport like that. It has a bad
effect on the young. Many thanks for
your suggestion. I'll give him a show
with a letter."</p>

<hr />

<h2>A QUESTION OF COURTESY.</h2>

<p>"Permit me, Sir, to pass you the
potatoes."</p>

<p>"After you," I inclined.</p>

<p>My fellow-passenger helped himself,
shrugging his eyebrows. It was a
provocative shrug&mdash;a shrug I could not
leave at that.</p>

<p>"You shrug your eyebrows," I challenged.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons," he answered;
"but one never escapes it."</p>

<p>He courted interrogation. "What is
it that one never escapes?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The elaborate unselfishness of the
age," he replied a little petulantly.
"I had two friends who starved to
death of it."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I offered him the salt.</p>

<p>"Observe," said my fellow-passenger,
"that when you offer me the salt I
accept it. Why should I deprive you
of one of the little complacencies of
unselfishness? You see, my dear Sir,
either you are to feel smug all over, or
I am. Now, if I take the salt&mdash;so&mdash;I
perform a true act of courtesy; but, if
I postpone the salt, saying 'After you,'
I at once enter into the lists, jousting
with you for the prize of self-satisfaction.
With my two friends it was, if I remember,
a matter of Lancashire relish. It
appears to me one of the ironies of Fate
that they should have starved to death
for want of a sauce. I am reminded
of an epicure who starved to death for
want of seasoning in his Julienne.
But doubtless you are more interested
in my two friends. I bow to your
impatience. Hugh said, 'Allow me to
offer you the Lancashire relish.' Arthur
said, 'After you.' Hugh was piqued
at this attempt to cheat his conscience
out of a good mark. 'By no means,'
he insisted. But Arthur, with a firm
smile of politeness, only repeated,
'After you.'</p>

<p>"Hugh stuck out, and Arthur remained
adamant. The contest lasted for
nine days. On the first day Hugh was
studiedly courteous. It was, 'I could
not dream, my dear Arthur,' et-cetera.
On the second day he was visibly
aggravated. It was, 'But, my dear
Arthur, confess now, was it not I who
offered you the Lancashire relish
first?' On the third day he was
ominously calm. It was, 'You had
better help yourself to the Lancashire
relish, Arthur.' On the fourth day
he was frankly fierce. It was, 'By
heaven, Arthur, if you don't take some
Lancashire relish...." And the only
words in Arthur's vocabulary all that
time wore, 'After you! After you!'
On the fifth day they came to grips on
the floor, and through the sixth day
and the seventh they swayed without
separating. I suspect that the strain
of this tussle assisted starvation to
its victory. On the eighth day they
were too weak for combat; they could
only glare at each other passionately
from opposite corners of the room; and
on the ninth day came the end.</p>

<p>"Arthur held out the longer&mdash;he had,
you see, wasted less breath. When he
saw Hugh gasping in the penultimate
throes of death, he mustered sufficient
strength to clutch the bottle, and even
to crawl over to his friend's side. Hugh
saw him coming and shut his teeth.
Arthur was too feeble to prize them
open with his hands, but he had no
difficulty in knocking out a couple with
the butt end of the bottle, and with a
faint groan of triumph he succeeded in
pouring the contents down the cavity
just before Hugh breathed his last.</p>

<p>"The exertion naturally hastened his
own end. He made an effort to reach
the well-stocked table of viands, but
expired on the way, murmuring a final
and, as it strikes me, rather too
dramatic 'After you!'"</p>

<p>"When you have quite done with the
cabbage," I rapped out....</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>The consideration of Fear seems to have a special appeal
for the <span class="sc">Benson</span> Bros. Only the other day did <span class="sc">Robert Hugh</span>
write a clever and hauntingly horrible story round it, and
now here is <span class="sc">Arthur Christopher</span> discoursing at large upon
the same theme in <i>Where No Fear Was</i> (<span class="sc">Smith, Elder</span>). It
is a book that you will hardly expect me to criticise. One
either likes those gentle monologues of Mr. <span class="sc">Benson</span> or is
impatient under them&mdash;and in any case the comments of a
third party would be superfluous. Personally, I should call
this one of the most charming of those many hortatory
volumes that have come from his prolific pen; he has a
subject that interests him, and is naturally therefore at his
best in speaking of it. Many kinds of fear are treated in the
book&mdash;those common to us all in childhood and youth and
age; and there are chapters dedicated to men and women
who have notably striven with and overcome the dragon&mdash;<span class="sc">Johnson</span>
and <span class="sc">Charlotte Bront&euml;</span> and <span class="sc">Carlyle</span>, and that
friend of his, <span class="sc">John Sterling</span>, whose letter from his death-bed
the author quotes and rightly calls "one of the finest
human documents." So now you see what kind of book it
is, and whether you yourself are likely to respond to its
appeal. It will, I am firmly persuaded, bring encouragement
to many and add to the already large numbers who
owe a real debt of gratitude to the writer. Somewhere he
has a passing reference to the time when first he began to
receive letters from unknown correspondents. It set me
thinking that it was no slight achievement to have said so
many human and helpful things so unpriggishly. And certainly
no one could call <i>Where No Fear Was</i> a pedantic
work; its qualities of gentle humour and, above all, of sincerity
absolve it from this charge and should commend it
even to those who, as a rule, suffer counsel unwillingly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Forrard, so to speak, in Mr. <span class="sc">Cutcliffe Hyne's</span> latest
book you shall discover the three redoubtable stokers from
whom it derives its title of <i>Firemen Hot</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>).
Combining the stedfast affection and loyalty of the <i>Three
Musketeers</i> or the imperishable soldiers of Mr. <span class="sc">Kipling</span>
with a faculty, when planning an escapade, for faultless
English, only equalled by that of the flustered client explaining
what has happened to the lynx-eyed sleuth, they
are as stout a trio as ever thrust coal into a furnace or fist
into a first mate's jaw. English, American and Scotch
(and this would seem to be another injustice to the Green
Island), in many ports and on many seas they have many
wild yet not wicked adventures, knowing, with an instinctive
delicacy born perhaps of the perusal of monthly magazines,
where (even whilst crossing it) to draw the line. Aft,
you shall come across once more the evergreen <i>Captain
Kettle</i>, with his sartorial outfit unimpaired, his endless
tobacco reserves not withered by a single leaf from their
former glory. About wind-jammers and tramp-steamers
and the harbours of all the world the author writes
familiarly as usual, and has several ingenious plots to
unfold, together with one or two that are not so good; and
I suppose that the whisky drunk in the pages of <i>Firemen
Hot</i> would float a small battleship, and the men laid out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span>with lefts to the jaw, if set end to end, stretch from Hull
to Plymouth Docks. I sometimes wonder whether Mr.
<span class="sc">Cutcliffe Hyne</span> ever in an idle hour picks up a book by
Mr. <span class="sc">Conrad</span>, and, if so, what he thinks of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I confess to being both weary and a little sceptical of
heroines (in novels) who leap from the obscurity of mountain
glens to fame and a five-figure income as dancers.
The latest example is the young person who fills the title
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> in <i>Belle Nairn</i> (<span class="sc">Melrose</span>), and of her I must say that
she displays almost all the faults of her kind. She certainly
did carry on! On the first page she ran away from the
humble cot of her virtuous parents to seek the protection of
an aunt whom she supposed (I could not discover on what
grounds) to be wealthy. However, so far from this, the
aunt turned out to be even worse-housed than the parents,
and in point of fact to keep what you might call a gambling-cot
on her side of the mountains, where a select circle met
to drink smuggled spirits and entertain themselves in other
ways that are at least sufficiently indicated in the text. So
<i>Belle</i> shook off the dust of the aunt also; and soon afterwards
found herself in an open boat, which was run down
by the yacht of some real live lords, to one of whom she
made violent eyes; at the same time giving an estimate of
her social position that went considerably beyond what was
warranted by the facts. It
was about here that I found
that my credulity with regard
to <i>Belle</i> was becoming
over-taxed, though it may be
that Mr. <span class="sc">Roy Meldrum</span>, her
creator, believed in her; he
has at least a solemnity and
sincerity of style that carries
him, apparently unwitting,
through every peril of the
grotesque. Of course <i>Belle</i>
comes to town, smashes all
booking records at the
Basilica, and establishes herself
as the idol of society. Later on, I regret to add, she
becomes, so to speak, tinged with wine. Perhaps this
unfortunate failing is the most credible thing about her.
So, while I envy those readers who will doubtless follow
her progress with delicious thrills, I can only repeat that
it left me entirely unconvinced.</p>

<hr />

<p>If I had to classify <i>Oh, Mr. Bidgood</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>), then I
should call it a confused comedy, but I should want to add
that Mr. <span class="sc">Peter Blundell</span> writes with such delightful
irresponsibility that the confusion does not make much
difference. To explain exactly what occurred during the
voyage of the <i>Susan Dale</i> from Ceylon until she was "in
distress" off the Borneo coast is not within my scope of
intellect, but I can draw up a short list of her passengers
(she was not supposed to carry any). I shall give <i>Mr. Todd</i>
pride of place, partly because he owned her, but chiefly because
sea-sickness incited him to deeds of gallantry. Then
there were two skittish nurses, who got on board because
one of them knew the second engineer; there was <i>Colonel
Tingle</i> (swashbuckler); <i>Se&ntilde;or Canaba</i> (scamp), who had
bribed both the captain and the chief engineer (<i>Mr. Bidgood</i>);
and lastly a brace of crafty Malays, who were the second
mate's contribution to the batch, and made a very reluctant
appearance upon the scene. Quite as important, however,
as this human freight was <i>Susan's</i> cargo of five hundred
kegs of gunpowder, shipped as pickled pork, and a wonderful
picture which at one time <i>Mr. Bidgood</i> was induced to
wear (it was unframed) as extra underclothing. This
expedient was not devised to prevent him from catching
cold, but to save the picture from being stolen. Indeed, if
anyone or anything had to be protected, <i>Bidgood</i>, for better
or worse, undertook the responsibility. A more engaging
old ruffian I have seldom encountered; among all the philanderings,
conspiracies and mutinies of this wild voyage he
remains a master of volcanic versatility. And his humour
is of the right <span class="sc">Jacobs</span> brand.</p>

<p>The really stupid thing about <i>Mr. Fergus Rowley</i> was
that he had never been to see <i>The Great Adventure</i>.
That popular play must have been running for a considerable
while (and the story appeared in book-form of course
much earlier) before he decided to "fake" a suicide from
the deck of the liner <i>Transella</i> and leave his large possessions
to an unknown and penniless nephew. <i>It Will Be All
Right</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>) is the sanguine title which Mr. <span class="sc">Tom
Gallon</span> has given to his latest novel; but whether he refers
merely to <i>Mr. Rowley's</i> optimism or to the further possibility
of his readers sharing that gentleman's ignorance of
current drama, is more than I can say. Anyhow, <i>Mr. Rowley</i>
disappeared, and his nephew succeeded to an estate largely
impoverished by the depredations of <i>Gabriel Thurston</i>, a
fraudulent solicitor and unmitigated rogue after Mr.
<span class="sc">Gallon's</span> own heart (and mine). Meanwhile, <i>Mr. Rowley</i>
was reduced to playing butler
in his own house and thereby
saving some of the most
precious of his curios from
the double waste of a spendthrift
heir and an unscrupulous
lawyer. There was also&mdash;need
I mention it?&mdash;a
Circe in the case. <i>It Will
Be All Right</i> is an exercise
in the picaresque school,
lacking none of the author's
usual raciness and vigour;
but, if at the end we find
<i>Mr. Fergus Rowley</i> still unable
to reinstate himself, and left with no better consolation
than the "Heigho" of his famous great-uncle
<i>Anthony</i>, the fault, I feel, was his own. He ought to have
looked in at the Kingsway Theatre and provided himself
with the indispensable mole.</p>
